Title: Bullet Hell Multiplayer Game (wip)

Vision Statement: A game that is both educational to develop and fun to play. 

Automated Tests: The tests we created are part of our main file, myfirstbanner.pde. Testing can be turned on by changing the boolean value "unittest" to true. The test we have simulates the keys being pressed and makes sure the ship moves in the appropriate way. It then prints out the results. Screenshot:
